# Future Direction

## Why
As can be seen in the figures below there are few downfals in the results:
1. borders
2. 

## How
The straight-forward way to get better model is to train on larger amount of data.
Since the train data recieved for this task is limited, here are the steps I would take:
1. Batch Normalization
2. Weight Regularization
3. Dropout
4. Model architecture changes
5. Retrain on fifferent hyperparameters sets.
